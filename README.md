# Day 12 - Lasso Regression for House Price Prediction 🏡

## 📌 Overview
In this project, I implemented **Lasso Regression**, a linear model with **L1 regularization**, to predict **California house prices**.

## ⚡ Algorithm
- **Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)**
- Works by shrinking coefficients of less important features to **zero**, making it a form of **feature selection**.
- Helps in avoiding **overfitting** and improving model interpretability.

## 📂 Dataset
- California Housing dataset from Scikit-learn.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy

## 📊 Results
- Evaluated using **MSE** and **R² Score**
- Sample predictions generated for house prices.

## 🚀 Next Step
Day 13 → Another exciting ML algorithm!
